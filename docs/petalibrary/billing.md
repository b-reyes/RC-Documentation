# Billing

## Service dates

PetaLibrary allocations are billed on a per-TB basis at an annual rate. Service start
and end dates are prorated to the nearest whole month per the annual rate. 

The University of Colorado fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30. Therefore, for new allocations or mid-year changes to allocations, we will bill through the end of the current fiscal year. For annual renewals, we will bill for the entire fiscal year unless you inform us otherwise.

### Special circumstances
If your grant start and end dates conflict with our fiscal year billing process, please reach out to discuss options. 

In all but the rarest circumstances, we will not bill for PetaLibrary services across multiple fiscal years due to the complexity it creates for our Finance, Planning & Procurement office. If you have grant constraints that demand that billing occur across multiple fiscal years, such as a multi-year grant that may be depleted of funds near the end of the grant period, please reach out to discuss options.

## Invoicing

### Billable Events
When a PetaLibrary billable event occurs, Research Computing will generate an
invoice. The following are billable events: 

* _Debit from speedtype on file:_
   * Creation of a new PetaLibrary allocation
   * Increasing the size of an allocation
   * Annual renewal of an allocation

* _Credit to speedtype on file:_
   * Decreasing the size of an allocation 
   * Decommissioning an allocation

### Invoice details
A sample invoice is shown below. The invoice details the services being billed for, and includes a speedtype for CU System customers. For new allocations, the speedtype will be the one provided on the new allocation request form. For renewals or additional space, the speedtype will be the last one used for the allocation in question. A Journal ID will also be provided, which allows you to find the university transaction in which funds are moved between speedtypes.

### Invoice recipients
If a PetaLibrary allocation has one or more billing contacts defined, invoices are emailed to the billing contacts, and copied to the allocation owner. If no billing contacts are defined, invoices are emailed to the owner.

### What to do when you require changes to your invoice
The invoice specifies a time frame for you to contact us to make changes. If anything on the invoice is incorrect, please notify us right away, and we will issue a new invoice. If we do not hear from you within the specified time frame, we will proceed with the charges outlined in
the invoice. Please take note of the PetaLibrary [policy for non-payment](../additional-resources/policies.md#petalibrary-non-payment).

### Annual renewal invoices
The most common billable event is the annual renewal. These invoices are sent out within 1-2 months of the beginning of the University Fiscal Year, July 1.  **Please carefully read the information on your annual renewal invoice and make sure that the speedtype we have on file is still valid**. If it is not, please let us know as soon as possible so that the invoice can be revised before the transaction posts.
